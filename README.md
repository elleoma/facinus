## FACINUS - set a 24/7 access on a Ubuntu/Debian PC you have physical access to with [gsocket](https://www.gsocket.io/) and other features

This script is setting up an Apache server on your Arch based linux distro and targets Ubuntu/Debian.

## Features
- **SSH**: Set up SSH server on target to quickly access from internal network.
- **WOL**: Check for wake-on-lan availability, to be able to wake any other pc's on network which ran the script.
- **24/7**: Fake a poweroff to keep the PC running 24/7.
- **Log**: Logs everything on your server.
- **gsocket**: Set up a gsocket service on target to access the server from anywhere.
- **Stealth**: Simple evading techniques to avoid detection.

## Installation
For now this script doesn't have checks for other distros than Arch based with pacman package manager. I'll add more checks later.
You just have to run the install script that will setup everything automatically for you.
```
sudo ./install
```

## Help
You can run ./install --help to see available options.
```
./install --help
